Absolutely. Here’s a clean “get the repo born” checklist, plus a PowerShell bootstrap script that creates a solid, documentation-first project skeleton.

## Step-by-step: create the Git repo and open in PyCharm

### 1) Create a new GitHub repo (no fork)

1. In GitHub, click **New repository**

2. Name it something like: `nba-azure-ml-pipeline`

3. Choose **Public** (if you want to showcase) or Private

4. Check **Add a README** (optional, either way is fine)

5. Do **not** add any secrets, credentials, or connection strings

### 2) Clone locally

In PowerShell (choose your projects folder):

```powershell
cd C:\projects
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/nba-azure-ml-pipeline.git
cd nba-azure-ml-pipeline
```

### 3) Open in PyCharm

- PyCharm → **Open** → select the `nba-azure-ml-pipeline` folder

- Configure interpreter:
  
  - Settings → Project → Python Interpreter
  
  - Create/select a venv (locally) for dev convenience

### 4) Run the bootstrap script (below)

- Save the script as: `scripts\bootstrap_repo.ps1`

- Run it from the repo root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\bootstrap_repo.ps1
```

### 5) Commit + push

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Bootstrap repo structure and docs skeleton"
git push
```

---

## PowerShell: bootstrap folders + starter files

Create `scripts\bootstrap_repo.ps1` with this content:

```powershell
[CmdletBinding()]
param(
    [string]$ProjectName = "nba-azure-ml-pipeline"
)

Set-StrictMode -Version Latest
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

function Ensure-Dir([string]$Path) {
    if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $Path)) {
        New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $Path | Out-Null
    }
}

function Write-FileIfMissing([string]$Path, [string]$Content) {
    if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $Path)) {
        $parent = Split-Path -Parent $Path
        if ($parent) { Ensure-Dir $parent }
        Set-Content -LiteralPath $Path -Value $Content -Encoding UTF8
    }
}

foreach ($d in $dirs) {
    if ($d.EndsWith(".gitkeep")) { continue }
    Ensure-Dir $d

Goal: Build a reproducible pipeline that extracts NBA data via `nba_api`, stores raw/base tables in Azure SQL, and uses Azure ML for feature engineering + modeling.

## Quick links

- [Architecture](./docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Decisions](./docs/decisions/)

## Status
- [ ] Repo bootstrapped
- [ ] Azure SQL provisioned (ARM/Bicep)
- [ ] Backfill ingestion working
- [ ] Daily incremental ingestion working
- [ ] Azure ML pipeline training working

# Project Log

This file is the running narrative of what we did, why we did it, what we learned, and how to reproduce it.

## Template entry
### YYYY-MM-DD — Short title
**Objective**
- What I was trying to accomplish.

**Work completed**
- Bullet list of concrete actions taken.

**Decisions**
- What I decided and why.

**Evidence**
- Commands run, screenshots, links to commits, outputs.

**Next**
- Next small, testable step.

# Architecture

## High level
- Source: NBA API via `nba_api`
- Storage: Azure SQL (raw/base tables)
- Modeling: Azure Machine Learning (feature engineering + training + evaluation)

## Design principles
- Minimize calls to NBA endpoints
- Idempotent loads (no duplicates)
- Backfill window (up to 3 days)
- Features computed in Azure ML, not in Azure SQL
"@

Write-FileIfMissing "docs/decisions/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md" @"
# ADR 0001: Record architecture decisions

## Context
We need an audit trail for key choices (storage, compute, orchestration, schema, ingestion strategy).

## Decision
We will use short ADRs in `docs/decisions/` for decisions that would be hard to reconstruct later.

## Consequences
- Better documentation for portfolio and future maintenance
- Slight overhead to write ADRs (worth it)

## Recommended folder structure (why it’s good for your “portfolio + documentation” goal)

- `ProjectLog.md` = daily “what I did” narrative (your hallmark)

- `docs/architecture` = the big picture

- `docs/decisions` = ADRs (makes you look *very* professional)

- `infra/arm` = infrastructure as code

- `src/` = real package layout (easy to port into containers/Azure)

- `notebooks/` = experiments, but production logic stays in `src/`

- `scripts/` = operational scripts (bootstrap, migrations, etc.)

---

If you paste your GitHub username + repo name (or just tell me what you named it), I’ll tailor the clone/push commands and I’ll generate a **first “Project Log” entry for today (2025-12-15)** so your documentation starts immediately.
