# ADR 0001: Record architecture decisions

## Context
We need an audit trail for key choices (storage, compute, orchestration, schema, ingestion strategy).

## Decision
We will use short ADRs in docs/decisions/ for decisions that would be hard to reconstruct later.

## Consequences
- Better documentation for portfolio and future maintenance
- Slight overhead to write ADRs (worth it)
